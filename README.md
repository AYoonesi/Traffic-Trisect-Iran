This is a way to pay 1/3 for your downloads if you are in Iran.

## How does this work?
In Iran, traffic of local messengers are calculated as 1/3 of of real traffic; Means that if you download 3GB of data from their servers, you will be charged for 1GB.

In this guide we will use a server to upload data on their servers and then download the data on your own computer. In this case you will pay for 1/3 of the size you are going to download.

**So before you begin, make sure that you have a server.**
